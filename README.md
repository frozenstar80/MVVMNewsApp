<b>Firebase Authentication</b> provides backend services for easy use the SDKs and in-built UI libraries to authenticate the user in the application. Most of the apps need the identity of the user, and after knowing their status, the app saves the user's data securely in the cloud. It aims to build a secure authentication system.


<b>Architecture Components</b> <br>
Google introduced the Android Architecture Components, a collection of libraries to help with some of these architecture-related pain points. This book uses several of them in the sample project at various points: Room, LiveData, ViewModel and Data binding.

The <b>ViewModel</b> class is designed to store and manage UI-related data in a lifecycle conscious way. The ViewModel class allows data to survive configuration changes such as screen rotations.

<b>LiveData</b> is an observable data holder class. Unlike a regular observable, LiveData is lifecycle-aware, meaning it respects the lifecycle of other app components, such as activities, fragments, or services. This awareness ensures LiveData only updates app component observers that are in an active lifecycle state.


Navigation refers to the interactions that allow users to navigate across, into, and back out from the different pieces of content within your app.
